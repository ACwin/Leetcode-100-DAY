### 题目

 **[374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)** 


We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:

-1: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
1: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
0: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).
Return the number that I picked.



Example 1:

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

### 二分法：

PYTHON:

```PYTHON
class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        left = 1
        right = n
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            ret = guess(mid)
            if ret == 0:
                return mid
            elif ret == -1:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left

```
C++:
```
class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while (left < right) { // 循环直至区间左右端点相同
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // 防止计算时溢出
            if (guess(mid) <= 0) {
                right = mid; // 答案在区间 [left, mid] 中
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // 答案在区间 [mid+1, right] 中
            }
        }
        // 此时有 left == right，区间缩为一个点，即为答案
        return left;
    }
};

```
## 复杂度分析

* 时间复杂度：O(\log n)O(logn)。时间复杂度即为二分的次数，每次二分我们将区间的长度减小一半，直至区间长度为 11 时二分终止，而区间初始长度为 nn，因此二分次数为 O(\log n)O(logn)。

* 空间复杂度：O(1)O(1)。
