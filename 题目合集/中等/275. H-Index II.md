### 题目

 **[275. H-Index II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/h-index-ii/)** 
 
给定一位研究者论文被引用次数的数组（被引用次数是非负整数），数组已经按照 **升序排列** 。编写一个方法，计算出研究者的 h 指数。

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n − h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

Example 1:
```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2
```

### Constraints:
```
n == citations.length
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
citations is sorted in **ascending order.***
```

PYTHON:
```Python
//时间复杂度：O(logN)
//空间复杂度：O(1)

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        n = len(citations)
        left, right = 0, n - 1

        while left <= right:
            pivot = left + (right - left) // 2
            if citations[pivot] == n - pivot:
                return n - pivot
            elif citations[pivot] < n - pivot:
                left = pivot + 1
            else:
                right = pivot - 1
        
        return n - left

```
